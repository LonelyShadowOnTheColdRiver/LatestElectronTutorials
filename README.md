# LatestElectronTutorials
A real-time update of the Electron tutorial repository, using the latest versions of Node, NPM, and Electron.

## Why
Currently, there is no complete real-time updated Electron tutorial. As a student interested in Electron, I am distressed by the lack of reliable and up-to-date tutorials, which use the latest versions of Node, Npm, and Electron.

Now, I plan to learn Electron while recording the learning process to guide future generations. Due to work reasons, this process may be lengthy, and I hope to be able to help students in need.

## About
I am not planning to learn from regular tutorials, starting with the history of Electron and writing the entire tutorial. Of course, I will supplement these after completing the main content.
